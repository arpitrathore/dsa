# Leetcode 921: Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid

Leetcode problem 921, **Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid**, asks us to determine the minimum number of parentheses that must be added to a given string to make it valid. A string is considered valid if every opening parenthesis `'('` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `')'`, and vice versa.

### Problem Overview
Given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'('` and `')'`, our task is to compute the minimum number of insertions required to make the parentheses valid.

### Examples:
1. **Input:** `s = "())"`  
   **Output:** `1`  
   **Explanation:** We need one more `'('` to make it valid: `"()()"`.

2. **Input:** `s = "((("`  
   **Output:** `3`  
   **Explanation:** We need three `')'` to close each `'('`.

### Approach

The key idea is to traverse the string and use two counters:
- `left`: Tracks unmatched opening parentheses `'('`.
- `right`: Tracks unmatched closing parentheses `')'`.

As we iterate over the string:
- When encountering `'('`, increment `left`.
- When encountering `')'`, if `left > 0` (there's an unmatched `'('`), decrement `left`. Otherwise, increment `right` to track the unmatched `')'`.

After processing the string, the sum of `left` and `right` gives the number of additions required.

### Java Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minAddToMakeValid(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '(') {
                left++;
            } else if (left > 0) {
                left--;
            } else {
                right++;
            }
        }
        
        return left + right;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity: 
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string (single pass through the input).
  
### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, since only two counters (`left` and `right`) are used.

### Conclusion
This problem can be efficiently solved in linear time with constant space by using a simple counting technique. Itâ€™s an excellent example of how to manage parentheses and apply basic logic to string problems.
