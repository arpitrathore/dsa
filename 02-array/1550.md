# Solving LeetCode 1550: Three Consecutive Odds

**LeetCode Problem 1550: Three Consecutive Odds** is a simple, yet interesting problem that tests your ability to identify patterns in an array. The task is to determine if there are **three consecutive odd numbers** in the array. Let's walk through the problem and solve it step by step.

## Problem Overview

You are given an array of integers `arr`. The objective is to find out if there are **three consecutive odd numbers** within the array. If such a sequence exists, you return `true`; otherwise, you return `false`.

### Example

- **Input:** `[2, 6, 4, 1]`
  - **Output:** `false`
  
- **Input:** `[1, 3, 5, 7]`
  - **Output:** `true`

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and check each triplet of consecutive numbers. We need to verify if all three numbers are odd. An integer is odd if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero (`num % 2 != 0`).

### Java Code Implementation

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        // Iterate over the array until the third last element
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++) {
            // Check if arr[i], arr[i+1], and arr[i+2] are all odd
            if (arr[i] % 2 != 0 && arr[i+1] % 2 != 0 && arr[i+2] % 2 != 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- The loop starts from the first element and goes until the third-to-last element in the array (`arr.length - 2`), as we're checking three consecutive elements at a time.
- For each iteration, we check if all three numbers are odd. If so, we immediately return `true`.
- If no such sequence is found, the function returns `false`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once, checking each triplet.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as no additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## Conclusion

The **"Three Consecutive Odds"** problem is a great way to practice working with arrays and conditional logic. It's simple, but requires attention to detail when checking consecutive elements. This type of problem is common in coding interviews, helping developers refine their array traversal and problem-solving skills.

Happy coding!
